# K8s Deployment Lab
In this tutorial, we will study different types of K8s deployment (Replication Controller, ReplicaSet, deployment) in order to horizontally scale applications and efficiently handle more loads.
## Replication Controller
ReplicationController is used to manage application scaling. It ensures that a speciÔ¨Åed number of pod replicas are running at any point of time. So we make sure that a set of pods is always up and available.
